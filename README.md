# About me
Iâ€™m 20y Male. I'm currently working on Several API's. I'm going to publish the work here once I'm finished with some of my projects. I'm interested in reverse engineering and making applications and data connections more secure, though I don't have that much experience in these fields, if someone is willing to give me a hand, I'll gladly take it.
The best bet how to reach me would be through Discord.
My Discord is `MenuGamer#1337`

## - Projects

### Song Lyric API
    This project is currently under work, but I think I'm about to finish it soon.
    
### Discord Bot
    I have created a Discord bot, though I'm not gonna share the code nor am I sharing the bot atm, since it's under development.
    Once I have gotten the bot into the state that I'm safely comfortable publishing it out into the world,
    I will post a link here where you can get your hands on the bot.
